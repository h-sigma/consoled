# Consoled - What and Why

## What

Consoled lets you run commands from a simple terminal-esque window during the editor or runtime. It's straightforward to get started: slap an attribute on a static function and type its name in the window to run it.
Naturally, the asset has a lot more features:
- Parameter support
- Previous Commands
- Temporary Object Memory to assign and use objects as parameters
- Support for instance methods
- Support for properties and fields

## Why

## Upcoming Features

- Text suggestions
- Recursive Commands
- Simple stored procedures
- Command interruption
- Multiple windows
- Runtime IMGUI window
- Recurring execution (e.g. every 0.5s) -- useful to create monitoring windows
- Modules, for easily enabling or disabling groups of methods
- Command categories

## Please Note

This utility is still in very early stages of development. The core is there, and it works -- on the surface. Please
report any bugs you find to harsh@aka.al or create a new issue.
